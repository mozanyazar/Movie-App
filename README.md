# Movie app using TMDB api

<h3 >
The main focus of this project was to learn React, so I did not spend much time on the user interface, as I wanted to concentrate on learning the technology itself.
</h3>

- This is a simple React learning project.

## I used the following tools and technologies

- Formik and Yup for form validation 
- Context for state management.
- firebase firestore for the db
- Firebase Auth for registration processes.
- tailwind css
- react-toastify 
- react-router-dom (useNavigate & useParams)



## FEATURES

- You have to login for using watch&watched list page.

- After logging in, you can add any movie to your watchlist and after watching it, you can move it to your watched list.

- You cannot add a movie to both your watchlist and watched list at the same time.

- You can also access the movie detail page, where you can view more information about a movie and write your thoughts and opinions about it. (for writing to comment you have to login)
